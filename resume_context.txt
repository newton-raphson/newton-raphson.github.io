Profile

PhD researcher in AI-native geometry and physics-based simulation at Iowa State University (advisor: B.
Ganapathysubramanian). My work bridges 3D geometry understanding, neural fields, and scal-
able physics engines. I build INR-based geometry, octree FEM, and shifted-boundary solvers that enable
differentiable, GPU-native simulation directly on implicit or generative 3D assets—advancing the next gen-
eration of real-time digital worlds.
I am now exploring fast INR editing, geometry-aware AI, and
GPU-accelerated physics for immersive systems.

Research Interests

• Neural 3D geometry: INR/SDF, generative editing, implicit shape reasoning

• Real-time physics: octree FEM, immersed methods, differentiable simulation

• Large-scale distributed AI systems and GPU-native PDE solvers
